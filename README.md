# GitPub: federating Git services

GitPub is a decentralized federation protocol based on the W3C's [ActivityPub][ActivityPub], which
extends [ActivityStream 2.0][ActivityStream2]. It provides a server to server API for pull request,
forking and subscription of repositories provided by Git web services (services like GitHub, GitLab, 
Gogs, Gitea).

## Collaboration

A specification like this must be agreed upon by at least some of Git web service implementations.
If you are a developer of such a software, please [join our discussion][work-group-discussion] and speak up.
We'll simply add you to the work group.

If you are experienced in writing specifications, you're also welcome to join the effort.

## Mailing List

We're still waiting for all the tentative work group members to join the mailing list.

All major discussion and decision making will happen in our Framalistes
[mailing list][mailing-list-archive].
Non-members may use the GitHub issue tracker or send us a mail at:
[git-federation@framalistes.org][mailing-list-address].
We can not guarantee to read all mail or GitHub comments; but we will try.
